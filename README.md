## Project Overview

The live project was part of The Tech Academy's Cybersecurity program. The project focused on simulating real-world security scenarios, utilizing tools like Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux. By working on tasks such as analyzing traffic using PCAP files and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, this project helped solidify my understanding of cybersecurity concepts.

### Key Tasks:
- Network traffic analysis using Wireshark.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in the OWASP Juice Shop using Burp Suite.
- Writing incident reports based on malware alerts and PCAP file analysis.
- Investigating hostnames and malicious files responsible for malware infections.

## Tools Used

The following tools were utilized during the live project:

- **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Burp Suite**: For web application vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
- **Kali Linux**: As the main operating system for penetration testing tasks.
- **VMware**: For setting up virtual environments.
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: For practicing web application penetration testing.
- **VirusTotal**: For scanning malicious files and URLs.

## Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Traffic Analysis**: Gained the ability to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, identifying anomalies and potential malware infections.
2. **Penetration Testing**: Learned how to exploit web application vulnerabilities using Burp Suite and analyze weak points in security implementations.
3. **Incident Reporting**: Developed skills to write concise and thorough incident reports based on the findings from PCAP file analysis.
4. **Malware Investigation**: Investigated and reported on malware infections by analyzing file and domain activity using VirusTotal and other resources.

## Usage

1. **Wireshark Analysis**: Use the provided PCAP files to practice network traffic analysis. Open Wireshark and load the PCAP file to inspect the traffic.
2. **Burp Suite**: Open Burp Suite and use it to interact with the OWASP Juice Shop web application. Practice vulnerability identification and exploitation.
3. **Incident Report Writing**: After completing your analysis, practice writing incident reports based on your findings.
